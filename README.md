# spring-boot-multiple-log-aop
## Introduction
As the person responsible for overseeing the observability solution for wealth products, my role involves customizing various functionalities to align with our business needs, even though we've acquired a software package from a vendor. One key area requiring substantial development is logging. We are tasked with building logging mechanisms from the ground up, engaging in discussions with the vendor to establish mutual agreement on aspects such as logging data fields, logging format, and logging correlation. 

Having dedicated time to research and discover effective logging solutions, I aim to document and share the insights gained through this blog for the benefit of others.





1. Using Multiple Appenders in Configuration (Preferred):
Pros:
Centralized Configuration: Manages all logging settings in a single logback-spring.xml file, promoting consistency and maintainability.\
Efficient Resource Management: Appenders are shared across the application, reducing memory overhead and potential logging conflicts.\
Granular Control: Allows fine-tuning of log levels, file locations, formats, and rotation policies for each appender.\
Dynamic Configuration: Can be modified at runtime without code changes (if using libraries like Logback's JMXConfigurator).\

Cons:
Initial Setup: Requires understanding of logging frameworks and configuration syntax.

2. Creating New Logger Instances:
Pros:
Code-Level Control: Logs can be directed to specific files from within code, offering flexibility for certain use cases.\
Customization: Can tailor logging behavior for specific components or modules.

Cons:
Potential Overhead: Creating many logger instances can increase memory usage and logging overhead.\
Management Complexity: Tracking and managing multiple logger instances can become cumbersome.\
Configuration Scattering: Logging settings are dispersed throughout code, making maintenance and global changes challenging.

Best Practices:
Prioritize configuration-based logging: This approach is generally recommended for most Spring Boot applications due to its centralized management, efficiency, and flexibility.\

Consider code-level logging for specific scenarios: When granular control within code is essential or when configuration changes are not feasible, creating logger instances can be appropriate.

Key Considerations:

Application Size and Complexity: For large-scale applications with numerous logging needs, configuration-based logging is often more manageable and scalable.\
Team Familiarity: If your team is comfortable with configuration files and logging frameworks, this approach is typically preferred.\
Dynamic Requirements: If logging needs change frequently or require runtime adjustments, configuration-based logging offers more adaptability.\
Remember: The optimal approach depends on your specific application requirements, team preferences, and logging goals. Evaluate the trade-offs carefully to select the method that best suits your needs.
