1. Using Multiple Appenders in Configuration (Preferred):

Pros:

Centralized Configuration: Manages all logging settings in a single logback-spring.xml file, promoting consistency and maintainability.
Efficient Resource Management: Appenders are shared across the application, reducing memory overhead and potential logging conflicts.
Granular Control: Allows fine-tuning of log levels, file locations, formats, and rotation policies for each appender.
Dynamic Configuration: Can be modified at runtime without code changes (if using libraries like Logback's JMXConfigurator).
Cons:

Initial Setup: Requires understanding of logging frameworks and configuration syntax.
2. Creating New Logger Instances:

Pros:

Code-Level Control: Logs can be directed to specific files from within code, offering flexibility for certain use cases.
Customization: Can tailor logging behavior for specific components or modules.
Cons:

Potential Overhead: Creating many logger instances can increase memory usage and logging overhead.
Management Complexity: Tracking and managing multiple logger instances can become cumbersome.
Configuration Scattering: Logging settings are dispersed throughout code, making maintenance and global changes challenging.
Best Practices:

Prioritize configuration-based logging: This approach is generally recommended for most Spring Boot applications due to its centralized management, efficiency, and flexibility.
Consider code-level logging for specific scenarios: When granular control within code is essential or when configuration changes are not feasible, creating logger instances can be appropriate.
Key Considerations:

Application Size and Complexity: For large-scale applications with numerous logging needs, configuration-based logging is often more manageable and scalable.
Team Familiarity: If your team is comfortable with configuration files and logging frameworks, this approach is typically preferred.
Dynamic Requirements: If logging needs change frequently or require runtime adjustments, configuration-based logging offers more adaptability.
Remember: The optimal approach depends on your specific application requirements, team preferences, and logging goals. Evaluate the trade-offs carefully to select the method that best suits your needs.
